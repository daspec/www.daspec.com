## Good specifications/test design guidelines

Although DaSpec does not technically impose any limitations on what you can describe or how you describe it, as long as it is in markdown format, there are some general guidelines that you should think about. These are not tool specific, in fact they will apply to pretty much any similar tool:
 
  * [Describe What, not How](idea_specify_what_not_how.md)
  * [Explain the purpose in the introduction](idea_explain_why_intro.md)
  * [Focus on key examples](idea_focus_on_key_examples.md)
  * [Clearly separate inputs and outputs](idea_clearly_split_inputs_outputs.md)
  * [Cover a single topic](idea_one_test_one_topic.md)
  * [Avoid mathematical formulas](idea_avoid_mathematical_formulas.md)
