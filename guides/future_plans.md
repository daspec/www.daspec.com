# Future plans

These are the things we plan to work on in the near future:

- async testing support in JavaScript
- markdown hierarchical list support 
- flexible support for automation components that execute before or after each specification, or before/after a set of specifications
- support for other platforms

If you have an idea for a new feature, or want to chat about the plans, please send an e-mail to the [DaSpec Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/daspec)
