# Grouping related examples into tables

This example shows how to use tables to describe calculation rules and state
transitions. This is useful when you want to show how individual parameters of
a complex operation impact the outcome, or group a set of independent, related
examples, so your readers can quickly understand them.  Each row of a table is
a separate, stand-alone example. Failures will be marked in individual
expectation cells, with the expected and actual value. For more information on
the syntax and the limitations, see the 
[Group related examples into tables](../../../guides/tables_as_sets_of_examples.md) page in the DaSpec Guide.  

**Try this:** change values of input or output columns, or edit the system under test to 
make it return the wrong results, for example by adding or removing valid country codes, 
then switch to the Result tab to see the impact.
