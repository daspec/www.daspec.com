# Checking for missing and additional list items 

DaSpec can pass around and evaluate lists, which is useful if you want to check for additional or missing items, or pre-populate databases and set up referential data. When you just want to use a name or a simple identifier for items in the list, use bulleted or numbered lists as in this example. You can also put more complex objects into lists, by grouping their attributes into tables. For more information, see the [Working with lists of objects](../../../guides/lists_of_objects.md).

**Try this**: add or remove items from the lists in the spec, and check how the outcome changes
