# Grouping lists of objects into tables

This example shows how to use entire lists of objects as parameters. This is useful for initialising repositories, setting up prerequisites, and checking that there are no missing or additional items resulting from a bulk operation.  For more information on the syntax and the limitations, see the [Lists Of Objects](../../../guides/lists_of_objects.md) page in the DaSpec Guide.  

**Try this:** add or remove item rows, or change quantity values in the initial specification, then switch to the Result tab to see the impact.
