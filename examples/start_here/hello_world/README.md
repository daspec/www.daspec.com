# Hello World from DaSpec

This is a trivial example demonstrating the basics of connecting an executable specification with a step definition and
a system under test. For an explanation how this works, see [Hello World walkthrough](../../../guides/hello_world.md). 

**Try this**: Modify the system under test to return a different result, break the regular expression for the matcher in the step definition, change the expectation or the arguments in the specification and look at the results to see the impact.
