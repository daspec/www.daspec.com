Hello World, this is DaSpec calling. The [development preview version of DaSpec](https://github.com/daspec/daspec-js) is now on GitHub, and the first version of this web site is live with some interesting examples that you can [try in your browser](/examples/). 

Don't get too attached to the API as it is -- this is a development preview version and things are likely to change significantly before the first public release.
