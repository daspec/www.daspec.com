DaSpec 1.1.0 is now available, bringing support for asynchronous execution and promises. If a step definition returns a `Promise` object, the
runner will wait until the promise resolves before moving on to the next step. You can also attach additional expectation matchers to the `then` handler of the promise that will be executed within the step, which is a good way to run expectations on the asynchronous process results. 

For an example, see [Asynchronous Promises](/examples/advanced/async_promises/) in the examples section. 

You can [install the new version using NPM or Bower](/guides/install.html).
